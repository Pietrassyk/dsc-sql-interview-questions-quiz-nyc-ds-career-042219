    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "NUMBER, TEXT, REAL , BLOB\n",
    "Other Types cannot be used\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Primary Keys are unique values within a table. Each Row in a Table can only have one Primary Keys. A Foreign Key is a Key from another table and can be sued to join on. Foreign Keys must not be unique from the original tables perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One to One : One key in Table 1 can have exactly one Foreign Key from Table 2\n",
    "One to Many : One key from Table one can have multiple Keys from Table 2 but each Key in Table 2 Has exactly one Key assoziated with Table 1\n",
    "Many to Many: Many Keys from table One can have many Keys from Table 2 assciated and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "SQLITE provides\n",
    "Inner Joins : The joined Tables results only Rows where Both Tables have a shared Value in the column that the join was apllied on.\n",
    "Left Joins: All Entries \n",
    "AND CROSS JOINS\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
